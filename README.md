# Cplusplus
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

What did you do particularly well?
I did well in creating my menu and displaying the 12 hour and 24 hour formats.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by adding more comments to my coding. It is a touch up to my work that I need to remember to include as it enhances the readability of my code.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it challenging to create the menu that allows the user to input and creates the output from that. Creating the menu to display is easier then the code outputting from the user input in my experience. I find the zybooks useful and coding tutorials on youtube to be helpful in my understanding of C++.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think that this project allowed me to use several coding skills. This will be useful in other projects or course work because it will allow me to have the skills fresh in my brain. Retaining code without consistent practice is a challenge for me. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using standard methods of coding and using an easy to read menu for the user.
